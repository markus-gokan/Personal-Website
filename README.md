Contained is the code for my Portfolio Website. It's also the first time I've made an HTML website myself, so bear with it if it's a little clunky. The greatest part about this is the ease with which I can now add projects to my website, as well as the automatic gallery component that fistributes my pictures without the need for tedious formatting for each one.

This site was built using the Docusaurus framework.
