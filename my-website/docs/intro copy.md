Struck by the ceaseless boredom of the COVID-19 lockdown, I used the extra time to pursue a long-time goal of mine— designing and building a custom electric longboard. With all the motivation and time that quarantining at home provided, I decided that if I was going to do it, it was going to be done right, and massively over qualified for any use I could possibly have for it. The following 8 months of research and prototyping led me to the creation of the board that I finally nicknamed ‘The Beast’ for it’s excessive nature and seemingly limitless power. Using a 96 cell lithium-ion battery, totaling 50.4V and capable of providing 240A, to power dual 3.5kW motors driving pneumatic wheels; ‘The Beast’ was able to easily accelerate me uphill at over 35 miles per hour. And while I never even came close to running out of charge, the enormous battery would be able to power the board for close to 40 miles— far longer than it look for my legs to turn to Jell-O.
