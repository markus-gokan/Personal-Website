    Hi! My name is Markus Gokan, a graduating Mechanical Engineering major currently based in San Diego, Califoria. I'm origionally from New Jersey though, and I spent a summer working in Fort Wayne, Indiana, so I'm no stranger to moving around the country as needed. I'm currently looking for full time employment after my graduation in the Spring. I hope you enjoy looking through my portfolio and getting to know me, check out my contact info at the bottom of the site if you have any questions!
