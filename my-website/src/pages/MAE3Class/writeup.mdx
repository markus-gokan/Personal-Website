          For the capstone project of my freshman year, I worked in a group to
          design and manufacture a robot capable of competing in a student 1v1
          bracket playing the game created by the professors.

          My focus was on developing our intake mechanism. Following the
          engineering design process the intake evolved into a claw actuated by
          two four-bar linkages. The design was frankly overkill, but I wanted
          to design something I had never worked on before, and settled on the
          four-bar linkage as a mechanism that perfectly suited our needs.

          Having two motors, as originally designed, resulted in the claw being
          slightly heavier than the towering arm could raise, and provided over
          30× the force that was needed. To compensate, an internal gear set
          was added to drive both linkages from one motor.
