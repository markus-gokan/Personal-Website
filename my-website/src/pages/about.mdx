   **Hi! My name is Markus Gokan,** a graduating Mechanical Engineering major currently based in San Diego, Califoria. Thanks for checking out my portfolio!

 <div className={styles.bio}>
I grew up in New Jersey, and I've worked or lived in 3 states ny now, so I'm no stranger to moving if need be. Currently, I'm continuing my education at UCSD, pursuring a Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering (graduating in June 2027), during which I will be advancing my expertise and honing my skillset before starting my career. The rest of my projects can be found at the Portfolio tab up above, as well as a semi-disconnected gallery of me doing random engineering stuff, my resume can be downloaded below, as well as a link to my Linked-in profile if you want to get in touch.
