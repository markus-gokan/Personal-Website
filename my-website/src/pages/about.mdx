      Currently, I'm continuing my education at UCSD, pursuring a Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering (graduating in June 2027), during which I will be advancing my expertise and honing my skillset before starting my career. I love to travel, and after moving across the country for college, I'm no stranger to relocating if I need to after graduating. The rest of my projects can be found at the Portfolio tab up above, as well as a semi-disconnected gallery of me doing random engineering stuff, my resume can be downloaded below, as well as a link to my Linked-in profile if you want to get in touch.
